# Robot Navigation with PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

## Overview

This project focuses on training a robot to navigate in a 2D environment using reinforcement learning. The robot utilizes the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm to learn optimal navigation strategies through trial and error. The robot's task is to navigate toward a goal while avoiding obstacles.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Uses PPO algorithm to train the robot.
- **Robot Navigation:** The robot learns how to move forward, turn left, and turn right in a simulated 2D environment.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot is penalized when it collides with walls or obstacles.
- **Goal-Oriented Training:** The robot receives a large reward when it reaches the goal.
